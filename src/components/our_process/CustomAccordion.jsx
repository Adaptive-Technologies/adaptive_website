            During this phase we deal with generating a detailed draft or "HiFi"
            and application architecture. How it will look and work on
            completion. Conducting user testing to verify a friendly and
            welcoming UI/UX.

            The "HiFi's" will be shared via a link which gives the possibility

            Here is where those designs become reality. We work from the agreed
